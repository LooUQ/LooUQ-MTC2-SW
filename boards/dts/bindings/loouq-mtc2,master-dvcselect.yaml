  The MTC.2 interface utilizes a Device Select pin, similar to SPI-CS, to multiplex 
  multiple slave shield boards. MTC.2 devices have a Device Select (dvcselect) input
  on pin 3 of the M.2 connector. When dvcselect is active (HIGH) this enables the 
  host/shield communications.

  For systems with multiple shields (slave/peripheral devices) the host system board
  typically has a I2C/GPIO expander that sources dvcselect. Alternately the host could 
  dedicate one or more GPIO pins to select peripheral shields. If assigning GPIO pins
  to dvcselect function
